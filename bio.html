		<h1>About me</h1>
		<p>
			I'm a native of Germany and grew up a child of the 80's. When I finished high-school I was convinced that I wanted to be a primary school teacher so off to university I went where I studied primary school education with English as a major.
		</p>
		<p>
			As we all know "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans" and when I finished with school in Germany I moved to England, specifically to Cambridgeshire. There I discovered Contra dancing - a form of American folk / social dance - a passion that was quick to ignite and is still burning brightly.
		</p>
		<p>
			At one of the dance events I met someone even more special than all the other wonderful people I had met dancing - an American fella, who whisked me away to the New World. And while on new beginnings I made changes to my professional life as well and went back to school to study computer science.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to dancing, I love to sing, sometimes to a fault, enjoy sailing and biking with my better half and staying in touch with my inner child.
